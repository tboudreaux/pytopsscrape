THIS TEST IS NOT YET FULLY IMPLIMENTED, DO NOT USE

See the note at the bottom of the repo readme for a rough explination of
why these tests are currently failing. Moreover, I think there are some
floating point rounding issues that make bit for bit similarity tests an issue.

As a proxy I have included a script to generate a comparison plot of opacity vs
temperature at Log(R) = -1.5 (as it is throughout much of the radius of a main
sequence star). You can run the test suite then run that script to generate a
plot. You should see that the target and Test results are on top of each other
while they differ by a few percent from the GS98 OPAL opacity curve.
