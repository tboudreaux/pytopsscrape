# pyTOPSScrape Tests

Series of Unit and Integration Tests for pyTOPSScrape. Note that code coverage
is not super high on these tests. I have primarily focused on testing the web
api so that you can quickly see if web form is still returning tables (as one
day it is sure to break).

This is all to say that you should still still validate all the results that you
get yourself!


## Running Tests
In order to run the tests you need to have pytest installed.

All you should have to do to run the tests is run the ./runTests.sh script
